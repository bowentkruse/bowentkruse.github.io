title: Anything but AI (Part 1) - SIFT Defect Detection 
---

*Updated October 2024*

## Anything but AI Series Introduction
Having manuevered my way into this industry years ago, my LinkedIn feed is now littered with two kinds of computer vision content. First, object detection demos where the author has used the latest YOLO architecture to once again detect cars on a freeway. Or second, an [OG](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/OG) begging people to stop using AI or machine learning for every use case. This series will attempt to solve/re-create these common demos without using AI or Machine Learning. 

## Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)
Scale-Invariant Feature Transform also known as SIFT, is one of those amazing hunks of math that makes you really wish you got that mathematics minor back in university. SIFT was created by David Lowe and patented under US Patent 6,711,293. The patent was filed in 1999 and granted in 2004. However, the patent has expired as of 2020 (patents typically last 20 years), meaning it can now be freely used.
