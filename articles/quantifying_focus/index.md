title: Quantifying Focus in Computer Vision Use Cases

*September 2024*

### Introduction

### Understanding Focus in Computer Vision
Pooling layers work the same way in a neural network. They take a large, detailed feature map and "shrink" it by summarizing the information. Max pooling, for example, keeps the most important or prominent feature (like keeping the sharpest details in the photo), while discarding smaller, less significant ones. This helps reduce the size of the data and speeds up the computation without losing the essence of what the network has learned so far.
